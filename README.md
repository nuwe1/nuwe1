### Hi there 👋 
I'm Marvin, a Full-stack software developer, an active open-source contributor, community advocate, developer advocate, documentation specialist, and remote worker, committed to creating insanely great experiences for the end-user.

Let me share a little about myself. After completing high school, I found myself with a lot of free time during my vacation, and I was unsure of how to fill it. Initially, I attempted to secure a job, but lacking experience, I was at a loss for what to do next. It wasn't until I stumbled upon a class that taught people how to make money online that I discovered my passion for software development. I tried out a few different options before settling on this path, and ultimately chose to major in Software Engineering when I began university.

During my second year at university, I learned about the Google Summer of Code program, which led me to discover open source software. Since then, I've spent time working with other developers on open source projects and have developed a deep appreciation for the collaborative process.

Unfortunately, I lost my job at one point, which left me feeling lost and afraid.
 In search of answers and a new direction, I embarked on a journey of self-discovery that led me to dig deep and rediscover my true passion: **building software that has a positive impact on the end-user.**

To me, an application is more than just computer software that performs a specific function for an end-user. It's about creating a seamless experience that meets the end user's needs. 

Therefore my ultimate goal is to design an unparalleled experience in every application I create. To achieve this, I focus on three key areas: **designing software that is user-centric, promoting the use of this software, and evangelizing its benefits.**


As a community advocate, my primary goal is to foster and strengthen relationships with users and the wider community.I plan to actively seek out feedback, address concerns promptly, and provide unwavering support to ensure a delightful experience. Additionally, I plan to create compelling content, organize engaging events, and conduct thorough training sessions that educate users and promote the application.


As an evangelist, I am dedicated to spreading awareness and generating excitement around the application. My role is to inspire and motivate others to try the product, and become passionate advocates themselves.


In my contributions to open source, I'm proud to be a member of the [GitLab heroes](https://about.gitlab.com/community/heroes/members/)  and a [GitLab steering committee member](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/community-relations/gitlab-heroes/-/issues/21). I've won two consecutive hackathons in [Q1](https://about.gitlab.com/community/hackathon/winners/) and [Q2](https://forum.gitlab.com/t/announcing-q2-2021-gitlab-hackathon-winners/56053) of 2021 and was featured on [GitLab's anniversary websites](https://about.gitlab.com/ten/) and [Imakefoss blog](https://www.imakefoss.org/curators/marvinkaregyeya/), where I helped curate content for open-source developers.

To reach my goal, I need your support. With each new project I undertake, my creativity grows, bringing me closer to achieving my objectives. You can assist me in attaining my goals by offering me the chance to collaborate with you on your projects, or providing any type of assistance. This might involve sharing ideas for projects I can work on, reviewing my work and sharing with me your thoughts, or offering advice on how to improve my skills. All contributions, no matter how big or small, are greatly appreciated
